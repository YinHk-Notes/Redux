<li><strong>Redux in Action<br><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/redux-in-action">https://www.manning.com/books/redux-in-action<br></a>A comprehensive book that covers many key aspects of using Redux, including the basics of reducers and actions and use with React, complex middlewares and side effects, application structure, performance, testing, and much more. Does a great job of explaining the pros, cons, and tradeoffs of many approaches to using Redux. Personally recommended by Redux co-maintainer Mark Erikson.</strong>

<li><strong>The Complete Redux Book<br><a href="https://leanpub.com/redux-book">https://leanpub.com/redux-book<br></a>How do I manage a large state in production? Why do I need store enhancers? What is the best way to handle form validations? Get the answers to all these questions and many more using simple terms and sample code. Learn everything you need to use Redux to build complex and production-ready web applications. (Note: now permanently free!)</strong>

<li><strong>Taming the State in React<br><a href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/learn-react-redux-mobx-state-management/">https://www.robinwieruch.de/learn-react-redux-mobx-state-management/<br></a>If you have learned React with the previous book of the author called The Road to learn React, Taming the State in React will be the perfect blend to learn about basic and advanced state management in React. You will start out with learning only Redux without React. Afterward, the book shows you how to connect Redux to your React application. The advanced chapters will teach you about normalization, naming, selectors and asynchronous actions. In the end, you will set up and build a real world application with React and Redux.</strong>

<li><strong>Modern React with Redux, by Stephen Grider (paid)<br><a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/">https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/<br></a>Master the fundamentals of React and Redux with this tutorial as you develop apps with React Router, Webpack, and ES6. This course will get you up and running quickly, and teach you the core knowledge you need to deeply understand and build React components and structure applications with Redux.</strong>

<li><strong>Redux, by Tyler McGinnis (paid)<br><a href="https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/redux/">https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/redux/<br></a>When learning Redux, you need to learn it in the context of an app big enough to see the benefits. That's why this course is huge. A better name might be <em>"Real World Redux"</em>. If you're sick of "todo list" Redux tutorials, you've come to the right place. In this course we'll talk all about what makes Redux special for managing state in your application. We'll build an actual "real world" application so you can see how Redux handles edge cases like optimistic updates and error handling. We'll also cover many other technologies that work well with Redux, Firebase, and CSS Modules.</strong>

<li><strong>Learn Redux, by Wes Bos (free)<br><a href="https://learnredux.com/">https://learnredux.com/<br></a>A video course that walks through building 'Reduxstagram' — a simple photo app that will simplify the core ideas behind Redux, React Router and React.js</strong>
