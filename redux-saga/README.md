### Redux Saga

**Redux Saga** is a middleware library used to allow a Redux store to interact with resources outside of itself asynchronously. This includes making HTTP requests to external services, accessing browser storage, and executing I/O operations. These operations are also known as side effects. Redux Saga helps to organize these side effects in a way that is easier to manage.
